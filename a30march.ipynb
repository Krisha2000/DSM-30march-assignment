    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. It addresses some of the limitations of these individual techniques by adding a new term to the loss function that includes both the L1 and L2 regularization terms. This allows Elastic Net Regression to select important features while also performing feature grouping and handling multicollinearity in the data.\n",

    " The optimal values of the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) for Elastic Net Regression can be determined through techniques like cross-validation or grid search. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the model with different values of alpha and l1_ratio, and evaluating the model performance on the validation set. Grid search systematically explores a range of parameter combinations to find the best values that optimize a specific evaluation metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared."

    "In Elastic Net Regression, the coefficients represent the relationship between each feature and the target variable. The magnitude of a coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, and the sign (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship. A positive coefficient suggests a positive correlation, meaning an increase in the feature value leads to an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient suggests a negative correlation."
